Hi, this is a project in the making. 

**About team lens 🫧**  
The goal is to build a team-knowledge-base-intelligence that helps us get up-to-date work information easily!
It can also serve as a learning partner via chatting, interative word gaming and so on.

**What's working 🌟**  
**Branch mvp_1**
A trial page where visitors can upload a file and discuss with the ai chatbot about it without the need to log-in. 
I'm testing different RAG pipelines and that's why there're a few of them in the backend.

**Next steps 🌱**  
I am going through fastapi documentation at the moment to restructure the app so that it could be safer, stabler and better organized.
Running in full capacity and deployment is expected in early 2026.
